# NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.

This program analyzes the sentiment towards Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies in the news articles. It uses news api as the source/input to the analysis. It tries to evaluate the sentiment statistics towards the two cryptocurrencies and compare the two currencies based on the statistical data.

The program also uses wordcloud to give a visual sense of the words with the highest frequency in the articles related to the two curriencies. It uses name entity recognition using SpaCy  to locate and classify named entities mentioned in the articles of both bitcoin and ethereum currencies.
